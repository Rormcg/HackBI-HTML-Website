            <h1>Here's Why YOU should go to HackBI VII</h1>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Our journalists have been keeping watch on the upcoming annual Bishop Ireton technology competition,
                    known widely as "HackBI". The fast-approaching event will be the seventh iteration of the HackBI contest.
                    Recently, we have begun to hear rumours claiming that this yeara's HackBI will surpass all of its predecessors.
                    Though in the past HackBI has managed to keep up a trend of steadily getting better with each passing year,
                    it has been largely suspected that this is an unsustainable track record that must be broken some time or another.
                    After last year's amazing effort by the HackBI team, experts seemed certain that Hack BI VI would be the peak of
                    HackBI's streak. Nevertheless, our sources insist that their postulations are correct. One anonymous witness
                    says, "They really have something big in store this year, and I am sure they will manage to outdo themselves yet again."
                    With this in mind one can be sure that this HackBI is certainly worth the visit. But what kinds of things 
                    might you do there?
                </p>
